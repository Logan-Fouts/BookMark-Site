# **HomeLab BookMarker**
## Description
This is a lightweight bookmarking app much like heimdall. Very useful for home labers like myself. Add bookmarks, check if your sites are up right from the dash, sort, and edit all bookmarks easily.

#### Note:
If you are using this in a homelab, Sites you do not have exposed to the internet will always show as down. If you want this functionality run the website locally with apache or something alike.
